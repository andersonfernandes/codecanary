AI-powered code review for GitHub pull requests. Catch bugs, security issues, and quality problems before they land in main.

## Quick Start

```sh
curl -fsSL https://codecanary.sh/install | sh
codecanary setup local
codecanary review
```

That's it. CodeCanary diffs your branch against main and reviews the changes locally.

## Why CodeCanary?

- **Fully automated** — runs as a GitHub Action on every push, or locally from the terminal.
- **Multi-provider** — bring your own LLM: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Grok (xAI), or Claude CLI. No vendor lock-in.
- **Incremental reviews** — on re-push, Go-driven triage classifies existing threads at zero LLM cost. Only changed code gets re-evaluated.
- **Conversational** — when authors reply to a finding, CodeCanary re-evaluates in context. It distinguishes code fixes, dismissals, acknowledgments, and rebuttals.
- **Native PR integration** — posts inline comments on exact diff lines, auto-resolves threads when code is fixed, and minimizes stale reviews.
- **Anti-hallucination** — explicit file allowlists, line validation against the diff, and distance thresholds prevent fabricated findings.
- **Cost-efficient** — uses a fast triage model for thread re-evaluation and a full model for review. Tracks per-invocation usage so you see what you spend.
- **Configuration-as-code** — project-specific rules, severity levels, ignore patterns, and context in `.codecanary/config.yml`.
- **Agentic loop** — pairs with Claude Code via the bundled `codecanary-fix` skill to review, triage, fix, and push until the PR is clean.

## Installation

```sh
curl -fsSL https://codecanary.sh/install | sh
```

Installs the `codecanary` binary to `/usr/local/bin` (or `~/.local/bin`). Supports Linux and macOS (amd64/arm64).

To self-update later:

```sh
codecanary upgrade
```

### Canary builds

```sh
curl -fsSL https://codecanary.sh/install | sh -s -- --canary
codecanary upgrade --canary
```

## Setup

### Local reviews

```sh
codecanary setup local
```

The setup wizard walks you through choosing a provider, entering your API key (stored in your system keychain), and selecting models. It creates a `.codecanary/config.yml` in your repo.

Then review your changes:

```sh
codecanary review                # diff against main, print to terminal
codecanary review --post         # same, but also post findings to the PR on GitHub
codecanary review --output json  # machine-readable output
```

Without `--post`, `codecanary review` is always local: it diffs your branch (with uncommitted changes) against the default branch and keeps state in `~/.codecanary/state/<branch>.json` for incremental re-runs. With `--post`, it fetches the PR from GitHub — pass a number or let it auto-detect from the current branch — and posts findings as review comments.

### GitHub Actions

```sh
codecanary setup github
```

This runs the same provider and key selection, then:
1. Installs the CodeCanary Review GitHub App
2. Sets your API key as a GitHub repo secret
3. Creates the workflow (`.github/workflows/codecanary.yml`)
4. Opens a PR with everything ready to merge

Once merged, CodeCanary reviews every PR on open and push. Draft PRs are skipped by default.

## Configuration

CodeCanary uses `.codecanary/config.yml` in your repo. The `provider` field is required.

### Minimal config

```yaml
version: 1
provider: anthropic
review_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
triage_model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

### Config with rules and context

```yaml
version: 1
provider: anthropic
review_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
triage_model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001

context: |
  Go REST API using chi router. Tests use testify.

rules:
  - id: error-handling
    description: "Errors must be wrapped with context using fmt.Errorf"
    severity: warning
    paths: ["**/*.go"]

  - id: sql-injection
    description: "Database queries must use parameterized statements"
    severity: critical

ignore:
  - "dist/**"
  - "*.lock"
  - "vendor/**"
```

Rules support `paths` and `exclude_paths` globs, and five severity levels: `critical`, `bug`, `warning`, `suggestion`, `nitpick`.

### Provider examples

**OpenAI** (also works with Azure, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `api_base`):
```yaml
version: 1
provider: openai
review_model: gpt-5.4
triage_model: gpt-5.4-mini
# api_base: https://your-endpoint.com/v1
```

**OpenRouter**:
```yaml
version: 1
provider: openrouter
review_model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
triage_model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

**Grok (xAI)**:
```yaml
version: 1
provider: grok
review_model: grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning
triage_model: grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning
```

**Claude CLI** (uses your logged-in `claude` session, no API key needed):
```yaml
version: 1
provider: claude
review_model: claude-sonnet-4-6
triage_model: haiku
```

You can also create a `.codecanary/review.local.yml` for personal overrides (gitignored) — its rules, context, and ignore patterns are appended to the shared `review.yml`.

For the full config reference including budget controls, size limits, timeouts, evaluation context, and the `review.yml` override file, see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## Credential Management

```sh
codecanary auth status    # show which API keys are stored
codecanary auth delete    # remove a stored API key
codecanary auth refresh   # validate and update credentials
```

Keys are stored in your system keychain (macOS Keychain, GNOME Keyring, KDE Wallet) with a fallback to `~/.codecanary/credentials.json`. Environment variables always override stored credentials.

| Provider | What you need | Where to get it |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Anthropic | API key | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| OpenAI | API key | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| OpenRouter | API key | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) |
| Grok (xAI) | API key | [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai) |
| Claude CLI | Logged-in `claude` binary | Run `claude` and complete the login flow |

## How It Works

### First review

1. Fetches PR metadata and diff (via `gh` CLI or local git)
2. Reads file contents for context (respecting ignore patterns and size limits)
3. Auto-discovers project docs (CLAUDE.md files) for additional context
4. Calls your configured LLM to analyze the changes
5. Posts findings as inline PR review comments (or prints to terminal)

### Incremental reviews (on re-push)

1. **Go-driven triage** classifies existing threads — no LLM calls for unchanged code
2. **Parallel evaluation** re-checks threads where code changed or the author replied (using the triage model)
3. **New code review** covers only the incremental diff, excluding known issues
4. **Auto-resolution** marks threads as resolved when the code fix addresses the finding

### Thread lifecycle

| Event | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Code fix detected | Thread auto-resolved |
| Author dismisses | Acknowledged, kept open for re-check |
| Author acknowledges | Noted, kept open |
| Author rebuts | Evaluated for technical merit, kept open |
| No changes | Skipped (zero LLM cost) |

### Safety

- **Anti-hallucination**: explicit file allowlist, line number validation against diff, max finding distance threshold
- **Anti-ping-pong**: resolved findings injected as context to prevent re-raising
- **Prompt injection protection**: repository content escaped before inclusion in prompts

## Agentic review loop

CodeCanary ships with a [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill, `codecanary-fix`, that drives a review → triage → fix → push cycle until the PR is clean. You stay in the loop — every fix is confirmed before it's applied — but the polling, fetching, and CI watching is handled by the CLI.

Install the skill once:

```sh
codecanary install-skill
```

This writes the embedded skill to `~/.claude/skills/codecanary-fix/SKILL.md`, where Claude Code discovers it in every session. Re-run the command after `codecanary upgrade` to pick up new versions.

Then in Claude Code, ask it to `handle codecanary` on your PR (or invoke `/codecanary-fix` directly) — the skill is auto-discovered and matched to your request via its frontmatter description. Two modes:

- **PR mode** (default) — watches the GitHub Actions review check via `codecanary findings --watch`, renders a triage table, asks you to confirm which fixes to apply, commits and pushes, then loops on the next review. Every finding you defer gets a reply posted on its review thread explaining why, via `codecanary reply`.
- **Local mode** — triggered automatically when no PR is detected for the current branch. Single pass against your dirty working tree. Applies approved fixes without committing or pushing.

The full skill contract lives at [internal/skills/codecanary-fix/SKILL.md](internal/skills/codecanary-fix/SKILL.md).
