# CodeCanary

AI-powered code review for GitHub pull requests. Catch bugs, security issues, and quality problems before they land in main.

## Quick Setup

```sh
codecanary init
```

This walks you through:
1. Installing the CodeCanary Review GitHub App
2. Authenticating with Claude
3. Creating the GitHub Actions workflow
4. Generating a `.codecanary.yml` config tailored to your project

## CLI

```sh
# Set up automated reviews on a repo
codecanary init

# Review a PR locally
codecanary review 42

# Review and post findings to the PR
codecanary review 42 --post

# Generate a config from your repo
codecanary review generate
```

## Config

CodeCanary uses a `.codecanary.yml` file at your repo root:

```yaml
version: 1

context: |
  Go REST API using chi router. Tests use testify.
  All exported functions must have doc comments.

rules:
  - id: error-handling
    description: "Errors must be wrapped with context using fmt.Errorf"
    severity: warning
    paths: ["**/*.go"]

  - id: sql-injection
    description: "Database queries must use parameterized statements"
    severity: critical

ignore:
  - "dist/**"
  - "*.lock"
  - "vendor/**"

evaluation:
  code_change:
    context: |
      Fixes must use errors.Wrap, not bare returns.
  reply:
    context: |
      Treat WONTFIX as acknowledgment.
```

### Severity Levels

| Level | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `critical` | Security vulnerabilities, data loss, crashes |
| `bug` | Logic errors, incorrect behavior |
| `warning` | Potential issues, performance problems, code smells |
| `suggestion` | Better patterns, readability improvements |
| `nitpick` | Minor style, naming, formatting |

## How It Works

### First Review

1. Fetches PR metadata and diff via `gh` CLI
2. Reads full file contents for context (respecting ignore patterns and size limits)
3. Builds a review prompt with your rules, context, and anti-hallucination guards
4. Calls Claude to analyze the changes
5. Posts findings as inline PR review comments

### Incremental Reviews

On subsequent pushes, CodeCanary is smarter:

1. **Go-driven triage** classifies existing threads — no Claude calls for unchanged code
2. **Parallel evaluation** re-checks threads where code changed or the author replied (using Claude Haiku)
3. **New code review** only covers the incremental diff, excluding known issues
4. **Auto-resolution** marks threads as resolved when the code fix addresses the finding

### Thread Lifecycle

- **Code fix detected** — thread is automatically resolved
- **Author dismisses** — acknowledged, kept open for re-check on future pushes
- **Author acknowledges** — noted, kept open
- **Author rebuts** — evaluated for technical merit, kept open
- **No changes** — skipped entirely (zero Claude cost)

### Safety

- **Anti-hallucination**: explicit file allowlist, line number validation against diff
- **Anti-ping-pong**: resolved findings injected as context to prevent re-raising
- **Prompt injection protection**: repository content escaped before inclusion in prompts
