# Review Flow

How CodeCanary reviews a pull request, step by step.

## Overview

The review pipeline has two modes of operation:

- **First review**: Reviews the full PR diff against the base branch.
- **Incremental review**: Re-evaluates previous findings and reviews only new changes since the last review.

Both modes run through the same `Run()` function in `runner.go`. The pipeline is platform-agnostic -- GitHub and local modes differ only in which `ReviewPlatform` adapter is injected.

## Platforms

Two platforms, routed strictly by `--post`:

| Context | Platform | How it runs | State storage | Output |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **GitHub PR** | `GithubPlatform` | `codecanary review --post` (locally or in CI) | PR review threads via API | Posts review comments on the PR |
| **Local** | `LocalPlatform` | `codecanary review` (with or without a PR for the branch) | `~/.codecanary/state/<branch>.json` | Prints to terminal |

`codecanary review` without `--post` is always local — even if the branch has an open PR. "Local is local": the branch diff (including uncommitted changes) is reviewed against the default base, and previous findings come from `~/.codecanary/state/<branch>.json`. There is no hybrid mode that reads GitHub but writes local state. Two consecutive local runs go incremental off the saved state (locked in by `TestLocalPlatformIncrementalHandoff` in `state_test.go`).

## Pipeline Steps

### 1. Fetch PR data

**GitHub PR** (`--post`): Fetches PR metadata (title, body, author, branches) and diff via `gh pr view` and `gh pr diff`.

**Local**: Detects the default branch (`main`, falling back to `master`, or the explicit `--base`) and computes diff from merge-base to HEAD via `git diff $(git merge-base HEAD <default-branch>)..HEAD`. Uncommitted working-tree changes scoped to the branch files are appended to the incremental diff on subsequent runs. Uses current branch name as the title and `git config user.name` as the author.

If the PR is a setup PR (only adds workflow files with no real code changes), the review is skipped with an informational comment.

### 2. Prepare review context

`prepareReview()` loads everything the review needs:

- **Config**: Reads `config.yml` (provider, models, budgets, timeouts). If a `review.yml` exists alongside it, its rules/context/ignore fields override the config. If a `review.local.yml` also exists, its fields are appended (not replaced) on top of `review.yml`.
- **Project docs**: Discovers CLAUDE.md files at the repo root and in every ancestor directory of a changed PR file. Skips `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, hidden dirs, and other build artifacts. Up to 10 files, 16 KB each, 48 KB total. Monorepos commonly keep per-app conventions (e.g. `apps/exchange-api/CLAUDE.md`) — those load automatically when a PR touches files under that directory, so the reviewer sees the conventions specific to the code being changed rather than only the repo-root overview.
- **File contents**: Reads changed files from disk with size limits (default 100KB per file, 500KB total). Skips binary files, ignored patterns, and files exceeding limits. When files are skipped, the diff is also filtered to remove their hunks (via `ScopeDiffToFiles`) and they are removed from the file list. The original unfiltered diff is preserved in `FullDiff` for finding validation.
- **Environment**: Builds a filtered env for LLM subprocesses (only allowed prefixes like `CODECANARY_`, `GITHUB_`, plus essential vars like `PATH`). Injects keychain credentials if not already set.

### 3. Create providers

Two `ModelProvider` instances are created from config:

- **Review provider**: The main model that reviews code (configured via `review_model` in config). When `advisor_model` is set (anthropic or claude provider only), the review provider also enables Anthropic's server-side advisor tool so a stronger advisor model can weigh in mid-generation — the triage provider never uses advisor, since its classifier turns are too short to benefit.
- **Triage provider**: A cheaper model for re-evaluating previous findings (configured via `triage_model` in config).

Each provider is constructed via the factory registry in `provider.go`. The provider name determines which adapter handles the API call (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or Claude CLI).

### 4. Load previous findings

The platform adapter loads unresolved findings from the last review:

**GitHub PR** (`--post`): Fetches review threads via GraphQL. Filters to CodeCanary findings only (detected by HTML marker comments). Extracts the previous review's HEAD SHA from the most recent review body — clean and all-clear reviews embed this marker too, so the baseline advances even when a push produced no findings. Returns unresolved threads, the SHA, and a count for fix_ref numbering.

**Local**: Reads `~/.codecanary/state/<branch>.json`, which stores the SHA, branch name, and findings array from the previous review. Converts saved findings into `ReviewThread` shape for the triage pipeline.

If no previous findings exist, this is a first review.

### 5. Triage and build prompt

This step diverges based on whether a previous review SHA exists. A previous SHA alone is enough to enter the incremental path — if previous findings were all resolved (no open threads), the incremental diff still scopes the review to commits since the last baseline, avoiding a redundant full re-review.

#### First review path

Calls `BuildPrompt()` to assemble the full review prompt. The prompt includes (in order):

1. System instructions (reviewer role, diff-only rules, side-effect awareness)
2. PR metadata (number, title, author, description)
3. Additional context from config
4. Project documentation (CLAUDE.md files in `<project-doc>` tags)
5. Review rules (from config) — filtered to rules whose `paths:` / `exclude_paths:` globs match at least one PR file. Rules scoped to file types not in the diff (e.g. CSS rules on a Ruby-only change) are omitted to keep LLM attention focused. Falls back to a general review instruction when no rules apply.
6. Ignore patterns
7. Explicit file allowlist (anti-hallucination)
8. Full contents of changed files with line numbers
9. The unified diff
10. Output format instructions (JSON schema, examples, escaping rules)

After building, `fitPromptForModel()` checks whether the prompt fits the review model's context window (context window minus max output tokens). If it exceeds the budget, it progressively drops the largest file contents first, then truncates the diff as a last resort.

#### Incremental review path (triage)

`runTriage()` handles the incremental case in two phases.

**Phase 1 -- Classify and evaluate previous findings**

First, an incremental diff is computed (`git diff <previousSHA>..HEAD`). Two diffs serve different purposes:

- **Activity diff** (incremental): Determines whether there's new activity to evaluate. If empty, threads with no replies are skipped (no LLM cost).
- **Context diff** (full PR diff): Used for classification and evaluation context. Ensures fixes from earlier pushes are visible even if they predate the incremental window.

`ClassifyThreads()` assigns each unresolved thread one of six classifications:

| Classification | Condition | Evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| `TriageSkip` | No activity diff, not outdated, no replies | Skipped (no LLM) |
| `TriageCodeChanged` | GitHub outdated flag, or file in PR diff | LLM evaluates with file-scoped diff + file snippet |
| `TriageHasReply` | Human replied (no code changes) | LLM evaluates reply intent |
| `TriageCodeChangedReply` | Both code changed and human replied | LLM evaluates both |
| `TriageCrossFileChange` | Changes in other files only | LLM evaluates with full PR diff |
| `TriageFileRemovedFromPR` | File no longer in PR | Auto-resolved by Go code (no LLM) -- thread resolved on GitHub |

Threads classified as `TriageFileRemovedFromPR` are auto-resolved without an LLM call. The Go code sets reason `file_removed` and resolves the thread directly.

For remaining threads, `EvaluateThreadsParallel()` runs up to 3 concurrent LLM calls using the triage model. Evaluation uses a **two-level approach** to balance precision and coverage:

- **Level 1 (file-scoped)**: The LLM receives the finding, the current file content (presented first), and a file-scoped diff. This catches same-file fixes with minimal noise. Most evaluations resolve here.
- **Level 2 (widened scope)**: Only when level 1 says "not resolved" and the thread is `TriageCodeChanged` (file is in the PR diff). The LLM receives the full PR diff with a prompt primed to look for cross-file fixes. This catches the edge case where the finding's file has unrelated changes but the actual fix is in a different file.

For `TriageCrossFileChange`, only the full PR diff is used (no level 1 — there's no file-scoped diff to show).

The LLM returns JSON: `{"resolved": true, "reason": "code_change"}` or `{"resolved": false}`.

LLM resolution reasons and their effects:

| Reason | Effect | Thread stays open? |
|---|---|---|
| `code_change` | Thread resolved on GitHub | No |
| `dismissed` | Ack reply posted | Yes (re-triaged on next push) |
| `acknowledged` | Ack reply posted | Yes |
| `rebutted` | Ack reply posted | Yes |

**Phase 2 -- Build prompt for new findings**

After triage, the pipeline builds an incremental review prompt using `BuildIncrementalPrompt()`. This is similar to `BuildPrompt()` but:

- Uses the incremental diff (or falls back to full PR diff if the incremental diff failed)
- Includes a "Known Issues" section listing unresolved threads (prevents duplicating them)
- Includes a "Recently Resolved Issues" section with findings fixed by code changes (prevents re-raising similar issues -- anti-ping-pong)
- Only includes file contents for files touched in the incremental diff

The prompt is then fitted to the context window, same as the first review path.

### 6. LLM call

If not a dry run and budget permits, the review prompt is sent to the review provider. The provider handles API communication (Anthropic Messages API, OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenRouter, or Claude CLI).

If the response is truncated (hit max output tokens), a warning is logged. The pipeline attempts to salvage complete findings from the truncated JSON by scanning backward for valid objects.

### 7. Process findings

`processFindings()` parses and validates the LLM's output:

1. **Parse JSON**: Extracts the findings array from the ```json fence. Falls back to bracket-matching if embedded code blocks break the regex.
2. **File validation**: Drops findings referencing files not in the PR.
3. **Line validation**: Drops findings whose line number is more than 20 lines from any changed line in the PR diff. This catches hallucinated line numbers and scope creep.
4. **Actionable filter**: Removes findings where `actionable: false`.
5. **Status tagging**: Tags all findings as `"new"` if this is an incremental review.

### 8. Publish results

**GitHub PR** (`--post`): Every cycle emits exactly one top-level CodeCanary review, decided by an edit-vs-post rule. `FetchLatestCodecanaryReview` reads the commit SHA from the most recent CodeCanary review's hidden marker:

- **Same SHA** (reply-only run, or a duplicate `synchronize` webhook on the same HEAD): the existing body is updated in place with `UpdateReviewBody`. Only the status block between the `<!-- codecanary:status -->` markers is swapped — inline comments and prior findings text are untouched.
- **Different or no SHA** (new commits, or first review on the PR): a fresh review is posted. The body variant depends on the cycle outcome — findings review, all-clear, activity summary (no new findings but cycle activity to surface), or clean review. All variants carry the same status block and baseline SHA marker. Older CodeCanary reviews are minimized (collapsed) before posting.

The status block lists non-zero counts for: new findings, resolved by code, file removed, dismissed by author, acknowledged by author, rebutted by author, still unresolved. The block renders nothing when all counts are zero, so clean reviews remain copy-exact.

Per-thread ack replies for dismissed/acknowledged/rebutted resolutions are posted earlier in the pipeline (`HandleResolutions`). Dedup is reason-agnostic: if the thread already carries *any* `<!-- codecanary:ack:... -->` marker, no further ack reply is posted. Reasons can shift across triage runs (LLM non-determinism), and all three convey the same outcome ("keeping open"), so one ack per thread is enough. Reply-only runs skip `SaveState` so the empty findings slice doesn't overwrite persisted state.

`codecanary findings` applies the same marker to filter deferrals out of its default output: threads with any `codecanary:ack:*` reply are treated as handled and omitted alongside GitHub-resolved threads. Pass `--include-resolved` to see them. This keeps the codecanary-fix skill from re-prompting on findings the operator already deferred.

**Local**: Prints the formatted result to stdout. Format depends on context: terminal (colored, human-readable), markdown, or JSON.

### 9. Save state

**GitHub PR** (`--post`): No-op. State is stored in the review threads themselves (the embedded JSON marker contains the SHA and findings).

**Local**: Writes `~/.codecanary/state/<branch>.json` with the current HEAD SHA, branch name, and combined findings (still-open + new). This enables incremental reviews on the next run.

### 10. Report usage

**GitHub PR** (`--post`): Writes token counts and cost to `GITHUB_ENV` for downstream workflow steps.

**Local**: Prints a usage summary table to stderr (model, tokens, cost, duration) if running in a terminal.

### 11. Telemetry

If telemetry is enabled (opt-in), fires an anonymous event with aggregate stats: provider, platform, finding counts by severity, token counts, cost, and duration. No code content is sent.

## Key Design Decisions

**Single pipeline, two platforms.** `Run()` never branches on "am I on GitHub?" The `ReviewPlatform` interface absorbs all environment differences. Adding a new platform (e.g. GitLab) means implementing the interface, not forking the pipeline.

**Two diffs for triage.** The incremental diff (changes since last review) decides whether to skip evaluation. The full PR diff (all changes) provides context for evaluation. This prevents the "triage horizon" bug where fixes committed before the triage baseline become invisible.

**Two-level triage evaluation.** Same-file evaluations (`TriageCodeChanged`) start with a file-scoped diff (level 1) to reduce noise — the full PR diff can drown out the relevant fix with changes from unrelated files. If level 1 finds no fix, a widened-scope fallback (level 2) sends the full PR diff to catch cross-file fixes. Cross-file evaluations (`TriageCrossFileChange`) go straight to the full diff. The file snippet (current code state) is presented first in all evaluation prompts, so the LLM checks whether the issue still exists before analyzing the diff.

**Per-thread evaluation.** Each unresolved thread gets its own LLM call with tailored context, rather than one bulk prompt. This allows fine-grained classification, parallel execution, and per-thread budget control.

**Anti-ping-pong.** The incremental prompt includes recently resolved findings so the LLM doesn't re-raise similar issues. Non-code resolutions (dismissed, acknowledged, rebutted) keep threads open for re-triage on future pushes, but post ack replies to avoid duplicate acknowledgments.

**Context window fitting.** After building the prompt, the pipeline estimates token count and progressively trims file contents (largest first) then diff to fit the model's context window. This prevents API failures on large PRs.

**Finding validation.** All findings are validated against the PR diff regardless of what diff the LLM prompt contained. Line proximity checks (within 20 lines of a changed line) catch hallucinated line numbers and prevent scope creep from rebase noise.
